Vehiculum Frontend task

I used Gulp 4, therefore we need to install node.js, Node Package Manager(npm) and Gulp-sass (npm install gulp-sass --save-dev).
I used Slick.js plugin, so we need to install Slick.js as well (npm install slick-carousel)
I used Sublime 3 to write the code and you can see the index.html in browser by opening the file with Google Chrome, for example.
